            <h1>ACϟDC Band History</h1>
            <p>
            AC/DC (stylized as ACϟDC) are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973 by Scottish-born brothers Malcolm and
            Angus Young. Although their music has been variously described as hard rock, blues rock, and heavy metal, the band
            themselves call it simply "rock and roll".
            </p>
            <p>
            AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, 1975's High Voltage. Membership subsequently
            stabilised around the Young brothers, singer Bon Scott, drummer Phil Rudd, and bassist Mark Evans. Evans was fired from
            the band in 1977 and replaced by Cliff Williams, who has appeared on every AC/DC album since 1978's Powerage. In
            February 1980, Scott died of acute alcohol poisoning after a night of heavy drinking. The group considered disbanding
            but elected to stay together, bringing in longtime Geordie vocalist Brian Johnson as Scott's replacement. Later that
            year, the band released their first album with Johnson, Back in Black, which was dedicated to Scott's memory. The album
            launched AC/DC to new heights of success and became one of the best selling albums of all time.

            <p>
            The band's eighth studio album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You (1981), was their first album to reach number one
            in the United States. Prior the release of 1983's Flick of the Switch, drummer Rudd left the band and was replaced by
            Simon Wright, being in turn replaced by Chris Slade in 1989. The band experienced a commercial resurgence in the early
            nineties with the release of 1990's The Razors Edge. Rudd returned to the band in 1994, replacing Slade and appearing on
            the band's next five albums. Their fifteenth studio album Black Ice was the second-highest-selling album of 2008, and
            their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 worldwide.

            The band's line-up remained the same for twenty years, until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement due to early-onset
            dementia (he later died in 2017) and Rudd's legal troubles. Malcolm was replaced by his nephew Stevie Young, who debuted
            on AC/DC's 2014 album Rock or Bust, and on its accompanying tour, previous drummer Chris Slade filled in for Rudd. In
            2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring due to worsening hearing loss. Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as
            the band's vocalist for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player and background vocalist Cliff Williams
            retired from AC/DC at the end of the Rock or Bust tour in 2016 and the group entered a four-year hiatus. A reunion of
            the Rock or Bust lineup was announced in September 2020 and the band's seventeenth studio album Power Up will be
            released this November.

            <h2>Original AC/DC Jailbreak video</h2>
            <p>
            After several years apart, beloved rock band AC/DC is getting the group back together for a new album.
            The band hasn’t cut a full album with the original members in a long time. However, they announced on Twitter
            that singer Brian Johnson, drummer Phil Rudd and bassist Cliff Williams have rejoined the band to crank out a new album
            titled “PWR UP,” their first studio record since 2014. The announcement came with a caption asking fans if they’re ready, 
            along with a photo showing the band members looking older but still ready to rock and roll with guitarist Angus Young, 65, 
            still sporting the trademark schoolboy outfit. Unfortunately for eager fans, the announcement of the album did not come 
            with a release date, leaving everyone in the dark as to when more music from AC/DC is expected to drop.
